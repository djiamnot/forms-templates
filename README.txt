FORMS
=====

These are some forms and templates that can be useful for various things ranging from office/business administration through proposals, applications and other useful things that may come in handy in a life of a freelancer/adminstrator/artist/programmer.

Some of these things are not authored by me but they are here either for reference or because I prefer to keep my own copy that is either corrected, modified or otherwise enhanced to suit my needs and preferences.  These forms do not contain any personal info or any information whatsoever that could identify any individual and presence of such information is purely accidental (I would like to be notified about any such flaws in the collection of these documents).
